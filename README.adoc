=== Description
Generic Vantage Point Tree (VPTree) is a space partitioning algorithm. +
This code is based on link:http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=130[] and link:https://fribbels.github.io/vptree/writeup[]

This implementation allows for generic point type (instead of only vector type points). Even aggregated point types are allowed.
Requirements for the point type are:

* Must have operator[] to access the elements
* Must have size() function to return dimensional size

The distance metric is a binary function of type: distance(point1, point2) +
Supplied metrics are:

* Euclidean full device metric
* Euclidean periodic boundary condition, PBC, metric
